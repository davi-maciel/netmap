# NetMap

**Visualize your personal network on an interactive map.**

NetMap is a personal mapping tool that helps you keep track of the people you know around the world. Add contacts to your private network, tag them with locations (hometown, college, work, etc.), and see where your connections are on an interactive world map.

**Note:** This is not a social networking app. There are no friend requests, followers, or connections between users. Your network is completely private and visible only to you. NetMap does not track anyone's location - all location data is manually entered by you.
